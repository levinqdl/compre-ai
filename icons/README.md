# Icon Files

This directory contains the extension icons in various sizes:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 px (toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 px (Windows computers often use this size)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 px (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 px (Chrome Web Store and installation)

## Creating Your Icons

You need to create these icon files for your extension. They should all feature the same design but in different sizes.

### Design Guidelines:
- Use simple, recognizable designs that work at small sizes
- Ensure good contrast against both light and dark backgrounds
- Follow Chrome extension icon design guidelines
- Use PNG format with transparency if needed

### Tools for Creating Icons:
- **Online**: Canva, Figma, Adobe Express
- **Software**: Photoshop, GIMP, Sketch
- **AI Tools**: DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion

### Quick Placeholder Creation:
You can create simple colored squares as placeholders:
1. Create a 128x128 px image with your brand colors
2. Add the text "CA" (for Compre AI) in the center
3. Resize to create the smaller versions

Once you have your icons, replace this README with the actual PNG files.
